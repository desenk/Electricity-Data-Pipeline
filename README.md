# Welcome to the Electricity-Data-Pipeline ðŸ‘‹
Electricity-Data-Pipeline is a tool that allows people in the field of energy systems to extract the Great Britain electricity market (a.k.a. balancing mechanism) data. The origin of the data is Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service [BMRS](https://www.bmreports.com/).

This tool was developed as a means of easier data extraction for our paper on the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on the electricity system [here](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14030635).

The dataset used in this publication is also made available on DataShare. Hence, if you are interested in the same datasets, please click [here](https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2979
