# Welcome to the Electricity-Data-Pipeline ðŸ‘‹
<Electricity-Data-Pipeline> is a tool to extract the Great Britain electricity market (a.k.a. balancing mechanism) data. The origin of the data is https://www.bmreports.com/

This tool was developed as a means of easier data extraction for our paper on the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on the electricity system [here](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14030635).

The dataset used in this publication is also made available on DataShare. Hence, if you are interested in the same datasets, please click [here](https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2979
